## File Structure

```
app/(browse)/(home)/
â”œâ”€â”€ _components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ live-marquee.tsx      # Stock ticker-style live streams
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ result-card.tsx       # Enhanced stream cards
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ results.tsx           # Main results container
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                  # Full-width home page
â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx               # Home layout

lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ feed-service.ts          # Enhanced data fetching
â””â”€â”€ format.ts               # Utility functions

prisma/
â””â”€â”€ schema.prisma           # Updated with viewerCount

app/api/stream/[id]/preview/
â””â”€â”€ route.ts                # Video preview endpoint (placeholder)
```

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile (sm)**: 1-2 columns
- **Tablet (md)**: 2-3 columns  
- **Desktop (lg)**: 3-4 columns
- **Large (xl)**: 4-5 columns
- **XL (2xl)**: 5-6 columns
- **Ultra-wide (3xl)**: 6-7 columns

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Video previews only load on hover
2. **Optimized Queries**: Reduced database calls with proper relations
3. **Efficient Rendering**: Minimal re-renders with proper key usage
4. **Image Optimization**: Fallback handling for failed thumbnails
5. **Smooth Animations**: CSS-based animations for better performance

## Future Enhancements

### Video Previews

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with CSS Grid support
- Mobile Safari and Chrome optimized
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Accessibility
