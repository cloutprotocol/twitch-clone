# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current sidebar implementation has a width discrepancy issue on wide desktop screens. On smaller screens, the sidebar appears with appropriate proportions, but on wide desktop screens (>1024px), the sidebar becomes too narrow relative to the main content area, creating a condensed and unbalanced layout. This affects the user experience by making the sidebar content appear cramped and the overall layout feel unbalanced.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user on a wide desktop screen, I want the sidebar to have appropriate width proportions so that the layout feels balanced and the sidebar content is easily readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application on screens wider than 1440px THEN the sidebar SHALL expand to a wider width (e.g., 280px or 320px) to maintain visual balance
2. WHEN viewing the application on standard desktop screens (1024px-1440px) THEN the sidebar SHALL maintain the current 240px width
3. WHEN viewing the application on tablet screens (768px-1024px) THEN the sidebar SHALL collapse to the narrow 70px width
4. WHEN viewing the application on mobile screens (<768px) THEN the sidebar SHALL remain collapsed at 70px width

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions between different sidebar widths so that the layout changes feel natural and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen size changes between breakpoints THEN the sidebar width SHALL transition smoothly with CSS animations
2. WHEN the sidebar width changes THEN the main content area SHALL adjust its left margin accordingly with smooth transitions
3. WHEN transitions occur THEN they SHALL complete within 300ms to maintain responsive feel

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sidebar width logic to be maintainable and consistent across all components so that future changes are easy to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining sidebar widths THEN all width values SHALL be centralized in CSS custom properties or Tailwind configuration
2. WHEN components reference sidebar widths THEN they SHALL use consistent class names or utility functions
3. WHEN new breakpoints are added THEN the system SHALL accommodate them without requiring changes to multiple files
